      June 2018: Hypothesis of exporting as third mission spillover the expertise about e-Learning
      and online collaboration methodologies from the campus. Pablocommons project starts to tell 
      people in the district about co-designing by civic technologies to map tacit resources of the
      district and face possible emergency situations...a train derailment, a flood, else...a pandemic?
      
      November 2018: Pablocommons is presented to the district association with the 
  
      April 2019: A laboratory about communication of cetaceans is provided to preschool children by playing water in the local school
https://kidscoda.github.io/  
  
      July 2019: The director of the local school permits to scan the school for virtual tours and share the pictures online with a open source license
  
      January 2020: A laboratory about virtual reality is agreed with the teachers in a second year primary class
https://scuolavirtuale.github.io/
      
      March-may 2020: online laboratories and meetings for associations, migrants, children

# CLASSIFICATION OF LEARNING...is it just a matter of forms?
      
      We classify learning as:
      
      * Formal - institutional 
      
      * Informal - daily activities and tacit knowledge
      
      * Non formal - traineeships, situated learning
      
      Three questions:
      1) where can learn, what and from whom according to the classification above?
      2) how communities of practice learn if their members can't meet anymore and are not virtual ones?
      3) Can we consider volunteers at the intersection of the "boundary work" among the three kinds of learning

# HOW AGENCIES OF EDUCATION COMMUNICATE...

      * SCHOOL -> presence or online teaching -> paper or digital homework, platforms
      problem of googleization of the digital school
      
      * COMMUNICATION AMONG FAMILIES -> mostly waterfall chats (telephony) 
      
      
      * SUPPORT TO PUPILS AND STUDENTS -> presence and (possibly) online depending on individual skills

# ABOUT THE THREE BUDDHAS

     The metaphor of the 3 Buddhas meditating each on his own representation of the world
      while pupils and students as -boundary agents- enter and exit daily the three worlds:
    
       SCHOOL - FAMILY - PUBLIC LEARNING CENTERS
      
      Can we have a network?
      
      What are the possible points of distribution? 
      How to connect these worlds ...and make the buddhas talk each other?
      Is it just an ontological problem, or a historical and cultural one?

# EMERGING SOCIAL
      
     The pandemic has given evidence that:
      a) emergence is a social fact (what emerges indeed is the "raw" social)
      b) there is not integration among agencies for learning when common goal is school
      c) childhood and youth are not the prime goal
      d) there is not yet a emergency plan, or at least is not working as it should
      e) given solidarity and proximity happened during the lockdown citizens felt less living in a city, 
      and more living in a neighborhood

# CIVIC TECHNOLOGIES

      This is achievable via so defined “civic technologies” to connect people to resources
      and ideas to improve city services and the local community.
      The creation of a digital community would allow public learning centers to begin
      sharing data and methodologies via hackering existing open source and access technologies.
      This method arises as a result of co-designing sessions with volunteers in order to provide 
      the ad hoc training and development of an open archive of best practices for the public
      learning centers to share and contribute to.

# INFRASTRUCTURING JUST LIKE CORAL "growing outward"

     When does learning practices become sustainable and scalable as collective process?
      
    * RESOURCES - shared and open
      
    * ACITIVITIES - can be asynchronous and modulars (standard?)
      
    * COMMUNITY - ubiquitous, stakeholding, no-parochial altruistic (like a coral reef?)
      
    * INFRASTRUCTURE - open, mutuable, developing, ...regenerative
      
      Can institutions live with that?

# VOLUNTEERING IN INVISIBILITY 
     
      Enrolment
      Are there special requirements?
      What and how much can/should a volunteer teach?
      Can there be wisdom and social media skills?

# WHAT AND HOW MUCH ABOUT DIGIFICATION OF PUBLIC LEARNING CENTERS?
      
      Are we going back to "normal life"?
      Shall we design for a post-pandemic society?
      Is it the digital a way to open some black boxes on how learning happens?
      Is it digital a way to make volunteers much visible and valuable?

# CONCLUSIONS      
   <center>
     What we need to do is not catch up, but leapfrog current best practices and design ubiquitous, 
     scalable and sustainable services for the citizens with the citizens.
     This might be achievable via so defined “civic technologies” to connect people to resources
     and ideas to improve district -> city services and the local community.
