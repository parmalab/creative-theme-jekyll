# PABLOCOMMONS: THE DISTRICT AS DIGITAL PLAYGROUND IN THE AGE BEFORE LOCKDOWN

 June 2018: spillover of the expertise about e-Learning and online collaboration methodologies
 from the campus to map tacit resources of the district to simulate risk management and build 
 scenarios about emergencies such as a train derailment, a flood, a pandemic 
 https://pablocommons.github.io/
  
 April 2019: A laboratory about simulation of communication of sea mammals supported by a website
 is provided to preschool children by playing water in the local school https://kidscoda.github.io/  
  
 January 2020: A hands on about virtual reality at school is agreed with teachers of the primary school
 https://scuolavirtuale.github.io/

# CLASSIFICATION OF LEARNING
      
     Learning is classified as:
      
      * Formal - institutional 
      
      * Informal - daily activities and tacit knowledge
      
      * Non formal - traineeships, situated learning
      
      Three questions:
      1) where can learn, what and from whom according to the classification above?
      2) how communities of practice learn if their members can't meet anymore and are not virtual ones?
      3) Can we consider volunteers at the intersection of the "boundary work" among the three kinds of learning

# ARE AGENCIES OF EDUCATION IN NETWORK?

      * SCHOOL -> presence or online teaching -> paper and/or digital homework on digital platforms
      
      
      * COMMUNICATION AMONG FAMILIES -> mostly waterfall chats by telephony
      
      
      * SUPPORT TO PUPILS AND STUDENTS -> paper based in presence and (sometimes) online

# THREE SOCIOTECHNICAL WORLDS (digitally un-interoperable)

   SCHOOL - FAMILY - PUBLIC LEARNING CENTERS
   
     The metaphor of the 3 Buddhas meditating each on his own representation of the world
      while pupils and students as -boundary agents- enter and exit the three worlds daily:     
      
      * Can we have a network?
      * What are the possible points of distribution? 
      * How to connect these worlds ...and make the buddhas talk to each other?
      * Do we need to connect such worlds... or is it a unshared ontological problem?

# WHEN THE SHOP FLOOR GOES DIGITAL IN THE DISTRICT
      
     The pandemic has given evidence that:
      a) "digital emergency" for learning is definitely a social fact;
   
      b) there is not integration among agencies for learning, 
         although the common goal is school success for pupils and students;
   
      c) learning assets and issues are tackled in different ways according to different contexts;
   
      d) is out there a plan? or at least is not working as it should;
   
      e) during the lockdown citizens felt less living in a city, 
      and more living in a neighborhood by connecting online

      * Can “civic technologies” connect people to resources
      and ideas to improve city services and the local community?
  
      * The trend might consider open source to allow citizens to share data 
      and create services: is it achievable?
  
      * Co-designing sessions with volunteers in order to provide the ad hoc 
      training and development of an open archive with shareable best practices
      for the public learning centers conceived as a digital network: a dream?

     Playing with canvases to design communities
      
    * RESOURCES - shared and open
      
    * ACITIVITIES - can be asynchronous and modulars (standard?)
      
    * COMMUNITY - ubiquitous, stakeholding, no-parochial altruistic (like a coral reef?)
      
    * INFRASTRUCTURE - open, mutuable, developing, ...regenerative

# VOLUNTEERING IN INVISIBILITY 
     
     
      a) Enrolment;
    
      b) Are there special requirements?
    
      c) What and how much can/should a volunteer teach?
    
      d) Is wisdom or common sense still enough to tackle education in a complex and changing world?
    
      e) Else?...

# WHAT AND HOW MUCH ABOUT DIGIFICATION OF PUBLIC LEARNING CENTERS?
      
      
      * Are we going back to "normal life"?
    
      * Shall we design instead for a post-pandemic society?
    
      * Is it the digital a way to open some black boxes on how learning happens?
    
      * Is it digital a way to make volunteers much visible and valuable?

# CONCLUSIONS?      

     What we need to do is not catch up, but leapfrog current best practices and design ubiquitous, 
     scalable and sustainable services for the citizens with the citizens.
    
     This might be achievable via so defined “civic technologies” to connect people to resources
     and ideas to improve district -> city services and the local community.
    
     Resistance to (free) innovation.
     
     Missing co-designing skills and long term digital projects.
    
     Q.: Shall we go digital and share open data? A: No! let's do a whatsapp group!
    
     Digital perceived and understood as a B- Plan: 
     "that thing online we have to use meanwhile we come back to "normal" life"
