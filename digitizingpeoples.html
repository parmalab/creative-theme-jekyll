# Classification of learning
      
      We classify learning as:
      
      * Formal - institutional 
      
      * Informal - daily activities and tacit knowledge
      
      * Non formal - traineeships, situated learning
      
      Three questions:
      1) where can learn, what and from whom according to the classification above?
      2) how communities of practice learn if their members can't meet anymore and are not virtual ones?
      3) Can we consider volunteers at the intersection of the "boundary work" among the three kinds of learning

# AGENCIES INVOLVED
  <center>    
  <div class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper">
  <iframe title="Anime Classroom" width="400" height="200" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/6e17b75780c044429323cd7ab6a5b83c/embed?autospin=1&autostart=1&preload=1">
  </iframe>
  </div>
      </center>
 
      * SCHOOL -> presence or online teaching -> paper or digital homework, platforms
      problem of googleization of the digital school? privacy issues?
      why teachers are not digital knowledge workers in a XXI Century society?
      school lag in a winning web strategy?
      
      * COMMUNICATION AMONG FAMILIES -> mostly waterfall chats (telephony) 
      ...what if you don't use whatsapp, or you need a PDF or a DOC
      instead than a screenshot or a picture?
      
      * SUPPORT TO PUPILS AND STUDENTS -> presence and (possibly) online
      where are the missing masses?

# ABOUT THE THREE BUDDHAS
<center>     
<div class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper">
    <iframe title="Buddha Bust - 3 textures and LOD's" width="400" height="300" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/7f54495d5360443196bbfcae07ce20cb/embed?autospin=1&autostart=1&preload=1">
    </iframe>
</div>
  </center> 
     The metaphor of the 3 Buddhas meditating each on his own representation of the world
      while pupils and students as -boundary agents- enter and exit daily the three worlds:
    
       SCHOOL - FAMILY - PUBLIC LEARNING CENTERS
      
      Can we have a network?
      
      What are the possible points of distribution? 
      How to connect these worlds ...and make the buddhas talk each other?
      Is it just an ontological problem, or a historical and cultural one?
      
# EMERGING SOCIAL
      
     The pandemic has given evidence that:
      a) emergence is a social fact (what emerges indeed is the "raw" social)
      b) there is not integration among agencies for learning when common goal is school
      c) childhood and youth are not the prime goal
      d) there is not yet a emergency plan, or at least is not working as it should
      e) given solidarity and proximity happened during the lockdown citizens felt less living in a city, 
      and more living in a neighborhood

# CIVIC TECHNOLOGIES
      This is achievable via so defined “civic technologies” to connect people to resources and ideas to improve city services and the local community.
      The creation of a digital community would allow public learning centers to begin sharing data and methodologies via hackering 
      existing open source and access technologies. This method arises as a result of co-designing sessions with volunteers in order to provide 
      the ad hoc training and development of an open archive of best practices for the public learning centers to share and contribute to.

# INFRASTRUCTURING JUST LIKE CORAL "growing outward"
<center>
    <div class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper">

</div>
      </center>
    
     When does learning practices become sustainable and scalable as collective process?
      
    * RESOURCES - shared and open
      
    * ACITIVITIES - can be asynchronous and modulars (standard?)
      
    * COMMUNITY - ubiquitous, stakeholding, no-parochial altruistic (like a coral reef?)
      
    * INFRASTRUCTURE - open, mutuable, developing, ...regenerative
      
      Can institutions live with that?

# VOLUNTEERING IN INVISIBILITY 
     
      Enrolment
      Are there special requirements?
      What and how much can/should a volunteer teach?
      Can there be wisdom and social media skills?

# WHAT AND HOW MUCH ABOUT DIGIFICATION OF PUBLIC LEARNING CENTERS?
      
      Are we going back to "normal life"?
      Shall we design for a post-pandemic society?
      Is it the digital a way to open some black boxes on how learning happens?
      Is it digital a way to make volunteers much visible and valuable?
      
      
      
      
# CONCLUSIONS      
   <center>
     What we need to do is not catch up, but leapfrog current best practices 
     This is achievable via so defined “civic technologies” to connect people to resources and ideas to improve city services and the local community.
